# Prospectus for Bitcoin Research & Ventures Company (BRVC)

A Prospectus for a Bitcoin-, Ethereum-, USDC- and Dogecoin-backed research, manufacturing and development-focused ventures company, primarily using in-house chains' coin(s) for utility use-cases and quoteunquote frontier-modeling; and for transparency purposes.  With plans to be located in the American states of Washington, Wyoming (for Manufacturing) and the two 'blockchain States': Louisiana (Operations, Legal) and Texas (HQ).  Forwardlooking statements not meant as securities of any kind.

# Week of 29 September 2025 - 5 October 2025

30 September

- Surveillance is reminiscent of renaissance, linguistically; yet artistically-inclined-thinking lets it run its course, The Renaissance, that is: still does. The word Reconaissance as a thinkthrough mechanism for avoiding what the U.S. Confederates attempted is nice, linguistically-speaking, if anything; but that's all it achieves here it seems: linguistical-analysis.

    - SSID broadcasting, is that considered speech now?

    - iOS SSID/Wi-Fi local area listing/viewing, is this now suspect?

        - In a general sense, Ethical Hackers and InfoSec peoples' work still does not make sense to traditional legislators because InfoSec/Hacker(s) are always trying to sidestep this granular aspect altogether, to get to their real work -- yet neither party here would consider SSIDs part of the 'Public Domain'

- Helpful visual: "Halt and Catch Fire"'s Texas Instruments employee and wife to Gordon is a great start to even beginning to know how to approach hardware-type security 'thinking': SHA- and AES- have been the one constant throughout Bitcoin (BTC)'s tenure: yet an unforeseen hashing algorithm's exploit coupled with a newfound hardware zeroday is what the good folk at Rand and other thinktanks might have been also inadvertently talking about and helping us somewhat prepare for, when talking about anything pre2025 

- IYI: The author (Satoshi)'s admiration for the work of The Rand Corporation continues to this day

- web3 and web5 threat surveillance is still in its infancy, arguably-speaking

    - dCEH (decentralized Chains Ethical Hacking) is an earnest way of attempting to ethically, transparently, even democratically, thinkthrough the ways and means in which we can preempt bad actors
    - If this all sounds vaguely or very academic, it is not
    - The old saying still stands: experience and certifications always trump traditional academia, IT-wise

- Possible dCEH exam question (web3 threat surveying, with web1, web2 esque bad actors acting-as-beligerents): Some rogue element decides to adopt the ubiquitous copy symbol (comprised of two rounded-edged squares) as theirs and deems it their default homepage symbol or verified checkmark en-kind for their faction's version of web3 or web5. Labels each square 'HeadQuarters,' i.e.,: HeadQuartersHeadQuarters. Subtly implying without overtly saying that classically-defined programming language schema(s)/styleguide(s) are the focus of this bad-actor-collective's exploit(s). Argues EFF and the possibility of a Digital Geneva Conventions as default responses, incessantly, on all domains they so choose or known to frequent. Internally, the leader is a long-time "Designed by Apple" hater, and they took the time to find vaguely EU-seeming IPs to spoof, wanting to leave in suspension the possibility of "2x the effect of the French Revolution," (as their rootkit's .nfo file says), whether in jest or not no one knows, also mentioning "just trying to understand CSS/PHP amirite?!" Soon after they only post "Good Will Hunting" MIT film-stills under an asyetunknown alias on some social media website, eventually mimicking a troll farm's activities, yet organically, strategically, in order to further obfuscate and confuse any agencies or InfoSec peoples

    - What tool(s) to use to document?

    - They've stolen an academic BitTorrent-as-a-Language LLM/QNL license, originating out of a hypothetical Sweden Strategic Reserve R&D account [simswap + salthash attack]

    - If no tools invented yet, which to invent? Use only OTP(s) to communicate with other Red/Blue/Yellow/White team members.

- Scenario: some NationState decides, unilaterally, to start creating new words in Latin. But just one word: Lan. And attaches Vosotros rules to it, solely to go further than other countries in banning intra-country cryptocurrency mining. Effectively inventing a word just to begin to persecute any and all connected ASICs and Nodes, using State-sanctioned language that said State would easily say it holds no ownership over. In essence: Romance linguistic(s) weaponized; libel law(s) captured and hollowed-out...or just classical escalation a-la-metasploitation

29 September

- Harvard University's Division of Continuing Education (Extension School) continuance of its use of wheat bushels within its logo as a form of currency for tuition is an interesting thought-provoker, historically-speaking.  So is the United Nation's wheat-/laurel-looking logo.  Why are we not to think of things from a satellite's perspective?

- HoneyPotlatch

    - A scenario in which two individuals, parties, et cetera decide to use their mutual exploits to work together, instead of taking the 'traditional route' of escalation for history's sake

        - A 'liquidation of the past' in an ethical, forwardfacing way, so as to actually be forward-capable, in Baudrillardian-esque terminology
     
        - 'Forgetting the past' but 'also-remembering-it, selectively' so to speak
     
        - Internal note: Is this something akin toward BitTorrent-as-a-Language (?)
     
        - Reverse example: late one random sleepless night some burgeoning avantgarde graphic designer shares his/her idea on social media that 'the State of Israel flag does not represent two towers with a bright light between them, when rotated clockwise 90degrees' in order to 'give it away to the 'greater good,'' hypperreality-speaking, potentially removing the inner-energy he or she usually reserves for creating something; someone then reads it and it changes his or her mindset if but only in a minute way; traditional hyperspace game/set theory continues onward —> until Selective factors (in mockery of U.S.C.) come into play, as Traditional American Values become more and more shared and transferred and transformed and converted et cetera et al
            - Metasploitation of essentially Pilgrim-era language/thinking

- Think of it like this: From a purely research-perspective, imagining some bad actor as having access to all the CCTV and satellite-feed(s) ever created in all of history is a good way to start unblocking one's mind from not thinking of another way to pre-empt said bad actor(s)

    - Intra-botnetweb(s), if you will
    - Technical-Linguistics-as-a-Path-On-the-Plain

- Tengwar-as-intranet-Protocol (?)

    - Both visually and as a thought-mechanism for virtual-architecture/SAN (?)

- https://youtu.be/8qRyTDbEskM?si=aCVxbaYwDriKviu4

    - Nice visual antecedent to the Ringwraiths-knocking-down-door scene at The Inn at The Prancing Pony, incase someone were to get the phrase "fifty" stuck in his/her head, filmscenewise
        - In my mind whenever I would think about this scene I kept recalling Mike Wallace saying "editorialize," which is a correct way of saying it, although in reality it was actually "edit"; but once I kind of forced myself recently to start working with Tor again, I could see how maybe perhaps it was a clue or something....Why else would I be sitting here writing about it within a cryptography-focused R&D startup's Prospectus?
    - Also a nice scene just inandof itself
    - Tobacco still is able to be considered currency

- Fact: Bitcoiners can fork AES/SHA as well

- What I was reading in Late 2014 that reminds me of what's going on right now: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1116944619

    - Essentially, then-President Lincoln would simply point to the applicable part of the Constitution, during times of confusion, while working with his opponents, not against

- Like an upside-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle">Sierpiński triangle</a>, maybe a new type of SHA-/PoW would use all of the Bitcoin versions (BTC, BCH, BSV, Knots, etc) as an option for further-enhanced hashing?  Just a thought.

    - Something like an ethical, decentralized BotNetWeb with BitTorrent-capabilities? (?)

- Thought experiment for possible future dCEH inclusion (?): What if it were to be found out that some country with known cyberwarfare-capabilities and with known ASIC manufacturing capabilities has had not only physical (ASICs) but SHA-/AES- rootkit(s) this entire time?  And posts the entire contents online, completely-verifiable?  Would we start to selectively de-legitimize some BTC?  Would we abandon SHA- and AES- altogether?  Would this kind/type of event finally make people focus on the actual hashing algorithms and notsomuch software-side of Bitcoin (BTC)?  Eventually we are going to have to work with, in a truly "work with" sense, the SHA- and AES- toolset.

- Bitcoin Pocket Reference (?)

    - Much in the same vein as Python Pocket Reference (October 1998) (?)
