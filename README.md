# Prospectus for Bitcoin Research & Ventures Company (BRVC)

A Prospectus for a Bitcoin-, Ethereum-, USDC- and Dogecoin-backed research, manufacturing and development-focused ventures company, primarily using in-house chains' coin(s) for utility use-cases and quoteunquote frontier-modeling; and for transparency purposes.  With plans to be located in the American states of Washington, Wyoming (for Manufacturing) and the two 'blockchain States': Louisiana (Operations, Legal) and Texas (HQ).  Forwardlooking statements not meant as securities of any kind.

# Week of 29 September 2025 - 5 October 2025

29 September

- HoneyPotlatch

    - A scenario in which two individuals, parties, et cetera decide to use their mutual exploits to work together, instead of taking the 'traditional route' of escalation for history's sake

        - A 'liquidation of the past' in an ethical, forwardfacing way, so as to actually be forward-capable, in Baudrillardian-esque terminology
     
        - 'Forgetting the past' but 'also-remembering-it, selectively' so to speak
     
        - Internal note: Is this something akin toward BitTorrent-as-Language (?)

- Think of it like this: From a purely research-perspective, imagining some bad actor as having access to all the CCTV and satellite-feed(s) ever created in all of history is a good way to start unblocking one's mind from not thinking of another way to pre-empt said bad actor(s)

    - Intra-botnetweb(s), if you will
    - Technical-Linguistics-as-a-Path-On-the-Plain

- Tengwar-as-intranet-Protocol (?)

    - Both visually and as a thought-mechanism for virtual-architecture/SAN (?)

- https://youtu.be/8qRyTDbEskM?si=aCVxbaYwDriKviu4

    - Nice visual antecedent to the Ringwraiths-knocking-down-door scene at The Inn at The Prancing Pony, incase someone were to get the phrase "fifty" stuck in his/her head, filmscenewise
        - In my mind whenever I would think about this scene I kept recalling Mike Wallace saying "editorialize," which is a correct way of saying it, although in reality it was actually "edit"; but once I kind of forced myself recently to start working with Tor again, I could see how maybe perhaps it was a clue or something....Why else would I be sitting here writing about it within a cryptography-focused R&D startup's Prospectus?
    - Also a nice scene just inandof itself
    - Tobacco still is able to be considered currency

- Fact: Bitcoiners can fork AES/SHA as well

- What I was reading in Late 2014 that reminds me of what's going on right now: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1116944619

    - Essentially, then-President Lincoln would simply point to the applicable part of the Constitution, during times of confusion, while working with his opponents, not against

- Like an upside-down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpiński_triangle">Sierpiński triangle</a>, maybe a new type of SHA-/PoW would use all of the Bitcoin versions (BTC, BCH, BSV, Knots, etc) as an option for further-enhanced hashing?  Just a thought.

    - Something like an ethical, decentralized BotNetWeb with BitTorrent-capabilities? (?)

- Thought experiment for possible future dCEH inclusion (?): What if it were to be found out that some country with known cyberwarfare-capabilities and with known ASIC manufacturing capabilities has had not only physical (ASICs) but SHA-/AES- rootkit(s) this entire time?  And posts the entire contents online, completely-verifiable?  Would we start to selectively de-legitimize some BTC?  Would we abandon SHA- and AES- altogether?  Would this kind/type of event finally make people focus on the actual hashing algorithms and notsomuch software-side of Bitcoin (BTC)?  Eventually we are going to have to work with, in a truly "work with" sense, the SHA- and AES- toolset.

- Bitcoin Pocket Reference (?)

    - Much in the same vein as Python Pocket Reference (October 1998) (?)
